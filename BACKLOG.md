# Backlog

Features and improvements deferred for future development.

## Deferred Features

### Terminal UI (TUI)

Interactive terminal interface using Bubble Tea framework. Removed to focus on CLI functionality first.

**Planned features:**

- Game selector view
- Mod browser with search
- Installed mods view with enable/disable
- Profile management view
- Settings view
- Configurable keybindings (vim and standard modes)

**Status:** Code removed, to be reimplemented once CLI is stable.

**Original implementation:** See git history before commit that removed TUI.
